            <p> Hi! I am Cameron Walsh. Welcome to my page!</p>
            <p> I was born and raised in Plymouth, MA. From there I left to attend Michigan State University. After graduating with a chemical engineering degree in 2012, I moved to Lafayette, LA to work for Baker Hughes, A GE Company. After almost 6 years of service in their Pressure Pumping department as a Field Engineer, I left the company so I could move to sunny Wauchula, FL and better take care of my family.</p>
            <p>Currently, I'm back in school learning web development in UCF's Coding Bootcamp and will be looking for employment after. In the meantime, I spend my time exploring Florida and playing fetch with my 4 dogs. None of them have yet to give me the stick back. One eats them.</p>
